What is Theory of Graphs?

The Theory of Graphs is a math branch wich studies relationships between objects in relation to a given set. For this purpose structures called Graphs = G(V,E), are used, where V is a non-empty set of objects called vertices(or nodes) and E(edges) is a subset of unordered pairs of V.
